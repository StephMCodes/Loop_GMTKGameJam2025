    [Dorm room]'
  - The same dread sits in my stomach, but somehow, it feels heavier than yesterday.
    Did I sleep in again? What are the odds that-
  - My phone shows the same date and time as yesterday. That's weird. And everything
    looks just as I left it the evening Molly and I fought.
  - She's still not here. And her phone shows the same date and time as mine...
  - This has to be a joke. If this is a time loop, maybe she needs my help. Or maybe
    my sleep schedule and all the paint I inhale has finally made me crazy.
  - Ah right! I drew last night. If my progress is still there, than this must be
    a bug...
  - ...Crap. It's like I never continued it.
  - Screw English class! I need to find Molly!
