  - Even though I'm alone, I make sure no one is looking before I go under the yellow
    tape and into the more secluded area of the beach.
  - What in the world... Those claw marks weren't there before. Signs of a struggle.
    Was it an animal? But the kid didn't really look like he got attacked, did he?
  - And that sludge on the ground... Looks gross, like an oil spill. Something's
    up here, and I have the sinking feeling it's my fault Molly ran off on her own,
    and that I need to fix it. But I need more information...
  - Autopsy reports, investigation results... Heh, guess my parent's were right when
    they said my art degree wasn't very useful. Kinda wish I was a lawyer or something
    right about now.
  - I need to find more clues. One of the reasons Molly and I fought is because I
    felt she was keeping things from me, and I got pushy. But now, I need to snoop
    until I find something.
