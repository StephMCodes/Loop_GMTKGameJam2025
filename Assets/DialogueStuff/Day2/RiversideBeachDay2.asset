    [Riverside beach]'
  - I checked all of our haunts, walking up and down way more stairs and hills than
    I usually do in a day.
  - 'On top of it, I asked whoever I figured might have seen her if, well, they did.
    It was mortifying: Molly''s the confident one, and I stuttered so much I eventualy
    resorted to just showing them a picture of her.'
  - Eventually, I came back to the beach. I figured maybe she was where they found
    the drowned boy. It's been weighing on her mind, since she was on duty that day.
  - But she swore that she saw nothing, and I trust her. But, in the end, she didn't
    trust herself anymore. Said she was confused, and wanted to fix it.
  - I should have just supported her instead of writing her off.
