    [Community library]'
  - I'm starting to get used to the dissapointment of not seeing her, and I hate
    the feeling. I hate that it feels like my fault.
  - No one here's seen her too, but after a bit more searching and waiting, I ask
    the librarian if they have any newspaper scans for 1913, and apparently, I'm
    the second person this week to look into it.
  - I inquire about this other person, and the librarian said she was about my age,
    with short hair. I show her the picture, and it's confirmed. Im following the
    right lead, if not too late.
  - Apparently, she also took out some books about urban legend myths, local ghost
    stories and a victorian novel on the occult. Interesting.
  - I receive a printed copy of the newspaper scan.
