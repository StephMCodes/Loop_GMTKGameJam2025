    [English class]'
  - One of the few classes we share, and the only one I have today.  Despite being
    a quiet, studious student, whenever I'm with Molly, we drive the teacher crazy.
  - We annotated The Great Gatsby, covering it in post-its every time we felt there
    was some subtext that felt "hella gay," as Molly eloquently puts it.
  - Judging by the board, seems like the teacher liked our essay. If only she was
    here to see it.
  - She's not the type to skip class, or at least, she wasn't, before what happened.
    I know she probably doesn't want to see me, but I need to talk to her and apologize...
  - She quit her lifeguard job, but Molly tends to go to the beach to relax. I have
    to try and find her after class.
