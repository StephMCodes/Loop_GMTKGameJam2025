    [9:37 AM]

    [Dorm room]'
  - This morning, I don't need five alarms to get out of bed. Instead, the dread
    sitting in my stomach pulls me from the covers faster than usual.
  - I scan the room for Molly, my roommate and a good friend of mine, but it seems
    she didn't want to have breakfast together.
  - It's fine, I dont feel like eating this morning anyway. Without her, I usually
    just skip it.
  - 'Hm, she must have been in a rush: she left her phone behind, the scatterbrain.'
  - Who am I kidding... Molly probably ran out of here to avoid me after our fight
    yesterday.
  - Let's just hope English class isn't awkward.
