    [Riverside beach]'
  - I call her. No answer. What if she forgot her phone on purpose..?
  - The beach is closed. Guess no one wants to swim after that boy was found drowned.
  - No sign of Molly... I should just let her come to me when she's ready, I guess.
    Maybe tonight, I'll order her favourite takeout.
