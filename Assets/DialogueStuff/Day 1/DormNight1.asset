  - ...Maybe she slept over at a friend's. I should just go to bed...
  - The dorm room is lonely without her. Molly was always cheerful and picks herself
    back up easy, but I guess there's a limit to everything.
  - Or maybe, in my selfishness, I always assumed she was okay. I can't even handle
    my own problems, and the thought that she also had her own was intimidating.
  - So I let her play the part of the smiling, easygoing friend. Now that I think
    about it, despite our closeness, we're always just barely out of reach of one
