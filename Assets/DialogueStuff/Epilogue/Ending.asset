    [Dorm room]'
  - I'm being lazy in bed when Molly comes out of our bathroom, smelling strongly
    of shampoo, soap, conditionner, body spray, cream... Just everything in our bathroom,
    really.
  - I pinch my nose. "Why do you smell like a girl's bathroom on steroids? Those
    products are expensive, you know."
  - Molly scratches her head apologettically. "I just can't get over how gross I
    was yesterday, eurgh. I can still feel it on my skin... like a phantooooom!"
  - 'I make a face. "Molly."

    "I feel alot better, though. How did you sleep?"'
  - '"Better knowing I''d see you the next morning." I blush at the saccharine response,
    and I''m not fully sure why.  "I still need to paint you, after all. Think of
    my grades."'
  - 'Molly puts a hand on her hip. "And I WON''T be getting some kind of not-so subtle
    interrogation, right?"

    "Promise."'
  - "Molly suddenly looks quite sincere, any joking fa\xE7ade dissipating. \"Thanks
    for finding me.\""
  - I look away from that sincere gaze. "It's nothing... you would have done the
    same for me. I'm glad we found out what happened for real. To think it was some
    messed up ghost story..."
  - Molly sighs. "I guess you were right. It wasn't anything I could have avoided
    or that I can even explain." She frowns. "I don't know how to feel about this,
    and what it means."
  - '"It''s scary, yeah."I find her eyes again, wanting to be honest. "But it still
    wasn''t right of me to brush you off and rush you getting over it for my own
    sake."'
