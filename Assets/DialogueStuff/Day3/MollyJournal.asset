  dialogue:
  - Her journal! Okay, sorry Molly, but I gotta read it.
  - "\"20/07: Got fired today. I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\r\n"
  - "There\u2019s a chance I can get the job back in a couple of years, if I do some
    more training, but\u2026 ugh, this is so messed up!"
  - "Nothing happened! I was watching the whole time\u2014 no one went under! No
    one was even out at the side where those people say they saw him! So how could
    this have happened?\r\n"
  - "Why won\u2019t anyone believe me?  Willow says it's not my fault, and not to
    blame myself for this kind of accident. To just move on.\r"
  - But everyone says it's my fault, so is she lying to me? Is she just brushing
    me off with all this moving on crap? In my place, I KNOW she wouldn't just move
    on.
  - "25/07: Had that dream like every night, the one about him drowning. This is
    the third time since. There\u2019s always something dark in the water around
    him\u2014 kinda like an oil slick? But with hands?"
  - "It\u2019s scary when I\u2019m in the dream, but when I remember it it\u2019s
    just like cheap horror game effects\u2014 some slime amalgamation or oil zombies
    or something."
  - "Really weird. Whoever\u2019s doing my dreams should hire a better effects guy."
  - Willow keeps trying to hang out and pretend everything is normal. It's starting
    to get on my nerves. We haven't talked about it since.
  - '28/07: There was a boat this time. I feel like every night, I understand the
    dream better. The oil amalgamation thing got me in the dream, and I saw a boat,
    and I woke up.'
  - "The\u2026 Her Majesty, I think? It looked old. Maybe it's a real boat.\r\nSomething
    happened to it. I think, whatever the oil hands are. The ghosts.\r\n"
  - "That\u2019s what drowned the boy. It has to be that.\n...I feel like a bad person,
    trying to justify what has to be my failure with some occult crap while I avoid
    my friend. \r"
  - "If it\u2019s not that, then it really was my fault."
