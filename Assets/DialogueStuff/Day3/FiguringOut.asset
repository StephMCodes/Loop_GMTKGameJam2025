  - "Occult nonsense doesn't sound like nonsense after being stuck in a time loop.
    Molly seems very keen on digging into this, so I think she may be right, and
    some kind of supernatural activity is at work.\r"
  - "Supposedly, ghosts are often made from some kind of regret, and there's potent
    amounts of it going around... Plus, Shipton's full of ghost stories and urbans
    myths. My nanna says she has prophetic dreams. Guess it's true.\r"
  - "Right. So those people who drowned, and that kid\u2014 they were taken by some
    sort of vengeful, grabby ghosts? The kind that wants to drown others the same
    way they went down? If that\u2019s what\u2019s happened to Molly, too\u2014"
  - "I have to go help her! If the ghosts are connected to the oil from the spill\u2014
    the water got all oily late last night, and what I saw come at me..."
  - "Maybe that was the ghost we\u2019ve both been dreaming about. Maybe I can do
    something to lure it out of the water. "
  - "Hmm\u2014 ghost hunting techniques? I\u2019d better do some research before
    I head to the beach tonight. I\u2019m getting Molly back from this thing no matter
    what.\r"
