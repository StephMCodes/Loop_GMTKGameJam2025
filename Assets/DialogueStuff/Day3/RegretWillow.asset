  - '"If I hadn''t hurt your feelings and brushed them aside all this time, you wouldn''t
    have faced this alone!" The words fall out of my mouth, hurried like I''ll run
    out of breath.'
  - I feel sick to my stomach, trying not to look behind me, as Molly instructed.
    But whatever's there is terrifying to Molly and the amalgamation too, who becomes
    erratic, so I can't run away.
  - I regret everything, and I've been trying to fix it. I couldn't bear to wake
    up and see you lifelessly float up to the surface-  I'd rather die, and I feel
    terrible for it.
  - Unlike you, I...I think I'd just rot in bed, or..." I swallow thickly, changing
    the subject. "I wouldn't be looking for answers, like you. Investigating all
    on your own.
  - We're both haunted, I think... But I've been pretending otherwise, and I'm sorry.
    I haven't been a shoulder to cry on, or someone to be supported by. Please, let's
    just talk.
  - I miss you, and I miss when we told each other everything. I love you a whole
    lot... you know that? You've always looked out for me, and I really admire your
    kindness. I want to return the favour."
