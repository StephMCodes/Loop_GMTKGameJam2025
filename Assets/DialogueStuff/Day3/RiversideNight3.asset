  dialogue:
  - There's a figure in the darkness... Molly!
  - But she looks... wrong. Covered in whatever that mysterious oil is. And she's
    pale, like a ghost. God, is that what happened to the kid? Would Molly's body
    float up to the surface tomorrow morning?
  - I couldn't bear to wake up if so. The regret would kill me, I think.
  - '"W i l l o w..." Molly''s voice comes out garbled, like her vocal chords were
    made of goop. The amalgamation tries to pull her under, and she struggles to
    remain upright.'
  - '"S t a y  a w a y..."'
  - '"No! I-I''m here to help!" I throw everything I have to the ghost, but damn,
    it looks more like an alien or a monster now, and im terrified. "Let Molly go!"'
  - The dark amalgamation keeps away from me as I wade towards her, as though me
    and the ghost were oil and water.
  - But nothing I brought seems to work, and I don't know any prayers, so all I can
    think of is to just approach Molly, and hope the oil stays off me too.
