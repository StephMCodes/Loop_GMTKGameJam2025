    [Dorm room]'
  - Aaah! What- what was that?! Where- oh, i've woken up again. Oh, god... It feels
    like a nightmare, but I think it was real...
  - I'm lucky to be alive. Or rather, I think the pure, distilled regret weighing
    me down is what's been keeping me alive, reliving this July 31st over and over.
  - Whatever I saw, it looked like those things I've been dreaming about. Hang on,
    Molly had been sleeping terribly too. Maybe we've both been dealing with the
    same thing...
  - Alright. I'm gonna snoop in her journal. She's kept one since we were kids, and
    I know she keeps it under her bed. I don't think she would have written where
    she's going, but there has to be something.
