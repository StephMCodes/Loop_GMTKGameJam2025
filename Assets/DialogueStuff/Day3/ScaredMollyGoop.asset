  - '"STAY AWAY!" Molly''s voice becomes clearer than I ever heard it tonight, and
    she shirks away from my touch, pulling heavily on the oil to wade further back.'
  - The oil's pulling her down, but she seems more focused on a point just above
    my shoulder, more scared than I've ever seen her. "D o n ' t... look behind you."
  - '"Just walk backwards... Walk away from all this, or I''ll have you on my conscience
    too. It''s all my fault, it  h a s  to be..."'
  - Horrified, the dread envelopping me becomes heavier and heavier, and I can't
    help but remained pinned where I am.
